3. channels (Safely communicate between concurrent tasks)


Out Of Box Experience

2. Go CLI (project initilization , build , code generation , retrieve dependencies,test ,profiling,documentation,report langauge bugs)



Cross Platform
1. GOOS = windows , GOARCH = amd64
2. GOOS = darwin , GOARCH = amd64
3. GOOS = android , GOARCH = arm


Backward compatibility ::
