1. Service Discovery
2. Load Balancing
3. Distributed Tracing And Logging
4. Service Monitoring

Types of Distributed Systems
1. Hub and  Spoke , All service will communicate with central service (Single point of failure)
    a. Great for centralized tracing and logs
2. Peer to Peer
    a. Highly Decoupled
    b. service discovery can be hard
    c. Load Balancing can be tricky
3. Message Queues(RabitMq)
4. Hybrid 

Architecturl Elements
1. Languages which we will be  supporting
2. Frameworks
3. what transport  we are  going to use
4. protocols which  are availables
5. how  are the messages sent , do  we need netural format
6. Are we a monoculture , are we use Go everywhere(Single Language)
7. Are architectures compatible
8. Do they support required transports and protocols
9. How stable are they? , are they easy to  upgrade


Transport:
HTTP ,  gRPC,  Other RPC ,  Mixed


Protocols:
    encoding/gob
    JSON
    protocol Buffers
    XML ,SOAP
    Mixed
